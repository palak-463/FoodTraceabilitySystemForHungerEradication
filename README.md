# Food Traceability System For Hunger Eradication Android App

Food Traceability System for Hunger Eradication is an application with three entities, farmer, restaurant, NGO. These three entities can be connected to each other in a way where the restaurant can buy grains and vegetables from the farmer,and donate its leftover food to the NGO. Also, the farmer can donate food to restaurants as well as NGOs. The NGOs would be receiving food from the farmers as well as restaurants. This system would thereby serve as a social and capital model which would eliminate the cost of middlemen, and thereby help NGOs receive food at a minimal cost, and the farmers and restaurants can sell their products easily, also, the restaurants can purchase grains and vegetables at a low price. Therefore, this system can be used to generate profit, and also reduce food wastage and help in eradicating hunger.
